# Hate Speech Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **Hate Speech Detection** system to classify text data (tweets) into three categories:
- **0** â†’ Hate Speech  
- **1** â†’ Offensive Language  
- **2** â†’ Neutral  

The goal is to explore multiple machine learning algorithms for detecting harmful or inappropriate language, helping to build safer online communication platforms.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **File**: `hate_speech.csv`  
- **Source**: Public dataset containing tweets labeled as hate speech, offensive, or neutral.  
- **Size**: ~25k samples  
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Lowercasing text
  - Removing punctuation
  - Removing stopwords
  - Lemmatization
  - Balancing dataset via oversampling

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud`
  - `nltk`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow`, `keras` (for preprocessing utilities)

---

## ðŸ“Š Models & Results
Three machine learning algorithms were tested:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**
3. **Random Forest Classifier**

**Best Performance**:  
- **Accuracy**: `90%`
- Metrics were evaluated using a train-test split.
